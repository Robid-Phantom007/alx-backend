# 0x01. Caching

## General :house:
* What a caching system is
* What FIFO means
* What LIFO means
* What LRU means
* What MRU means
* What LFU means
* What the purpose of a caching system
* What limits a caching system have

## Requirements :page_with_curl:
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Tasks and Files :heavy_check_mark:
* 0. Basic dictionary
    * Create a class BasicCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:
* 1. FIFO caching

* 2. LIFO Caching
    * Create a class LIFOCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:
* 3. LRU Caching
    * Create a class LRUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:
* 4. MRU Caching
    * Create a class MRUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:
* 5. LFU Caching
    * Create a class LFUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:
